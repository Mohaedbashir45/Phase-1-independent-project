*Phase one project documentation**

**Project Overview:**

**Title**:  **_"Moringa's Lost and Found Application"_**

Mohamed Bashir Sheikh is the project owner for the initiative titled "  **_Moringa's Lost and Found Application_**
." The project addresses a significant challenge at Moringa School where the issue of lost items hampers the students'
 ability to recover their belongings, leading to conflicts within the school community. This problem disrupts daily
  routines, causes frustration, and places an additional burden on school staff, who must manage complaints and conflicts 
  arising from lost items.

**_Problem Statement:_**

The problem of lost items at Moringa School not only affects individual students but also disrupts the overall learning 
environment. The current lack of an efficient recovery process contributes to conflicts and inconvenience, hindering the 
smooth functioning of daily activities.

**_Proposed Solution:_**

To overcome this challenge, a solution involves the development of an online application tailored for Moringa School. 
This application will provide a user-friendly interface, featuring a search bar where students can input the name of 
their lost items. The application will utilize a centralized database to quickly identify matches and provide information
